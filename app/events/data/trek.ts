      description: `Trekking in Uttarakhand, has so far, been synonymous with trekking in Garhwal. But Ranthan Kharak reveals the hidden magic of Kumaon. The trek weaves through quaint villages, and vast clearings and leads you to ridges offering incredible mountain views.
  
  However, the main surprise waits in the forests ahead of Namik. This is where you start seeing rhododendrons. If you are trekking in April, at the peak of the blooming season, the sheer abundance and diversity of flowers blow your mind. From bushes and shrubs to tall, stout Rhodo trees- you see them all. Reds and pinks and whitesâ€“ they are everywhere.`,
